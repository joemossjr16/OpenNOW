# Metal 4 streaming renderer

## Rendering

Hardware-decoded frames enter a bounded latest-frame mailbox. A display clock submits at most three GPU frames; stale pending frames are replaced without buffering extra latency. Direct PQ HDR avoids the intermediate linear image when no effects are requested. Native SDR/PQ/HLG conversion, linear-light sharpening and MetalFX spatial upscaling share a Metal 4 command buffer with explicit pass dependencies. Unsupported inputs/devices or GPU failures use the compatible renderer.

Metal 4 queues register the display layer's unmodified residency set through `NativeStreamMetalDrawableResidency`. Per-frame residency still covers decoder planes, uniforms, intermediate textures and lookup tables. The layer owns presentation-resource tracking across drawable reuse and format/size changes. Drawables use waitForDrawable → commit → signalDrawable → present. Drawable completion follows Apple’s Metal 4 sample; immediate presentation remains enabled.

Three slots bound resource reuse. GPU feedback retains decoded IOSurfaces and texture wrappers until work completes. Both native input paths use the same fragment-read alias visibility barrier for recycled decoder surfaces; retention alone does not provide cache coherence. Shared GPU events order switches between native/effects/compatible queues and recover skipped signals after GPU failure. No CPU readback, presentation-copy bridge, diagnostic launch override, frame interpolation or per-frame disk tracing is part of playback.

PQ conversion preserves BT.2020 HDR. HLG and SDR transfer lookup tables are prepared off the display thread. HDR intermediates retain half-float highlights; both HDR transfers present through a PQ BT.2020 10-bit EDR drawable. Framebuffer geometry preserves fit/fill and chroma detail. MetalFX presets select source resolutions without changing HDR, codec or requested FPS. Runtime upscaling requires at least 18% enlargement on both fitted dimensions, independently of preset selection; near-native PQ HDR stays on the direct single-pass path when sharpening is off.

## User controls and stats

MetalFX and sharpening controls remain in Settings and the stream Picture panel. Live MetalFX choices persist for future sessions. Normal stats show source/decoded/displayed FPS, loss, latency, codec and received color mode. Displayed FPS counts actual drawable callbacks through a small thread-safe tracker. Standard error reporting remains; Apple's developer HUD and the temporary timing/cadence trace system are removed.

## Validation

On Apple Silicon with the current Xcode SDK:

```sh
python3 ios/OpenNOWiOS/BuildScripts/validate-metal4-hdr-macos.py
python3 ios/OpenNOWiOS/BuildScripts/validate-metal4-effects-macos.py
python3 ios/OpenNOWiOS/BuildScripts/validate-video-effects-macos.py
```

The GPU harnesses check actual pixels for chroma/range/transfer, HDR highlights, orientation, sharpening, MetalFX, recycled surfaces and cross-queue switching. Effects validation also presents actual layer-resident HDR/MetalFX drawables. Simulator tests cover settings migration, displayed FPS, input, navigation and lifecycle behavior. These do not establish sustained 120 FPS or physical iPad support. Historical experiments are archived locally in `Build/cleanup-before-150`; build-150 cleanup details are in [METAL4-CLEANUP-150.md](METAL4-CLEANUP-150.md).

## Renderer selection

Metal 4 Rendering is a saved opt-in toggle, defaulting off for new and existing installations. It appears in Settings → Stream and the live Picture panel. Pipeline preparation starts only after opt-in; all Metal 4 submission paths are gated by the current choice. In-flight frames complete normally when switched off. HDR and MetalFX settings remain independent, and unsupported devices use compatible rendering.
