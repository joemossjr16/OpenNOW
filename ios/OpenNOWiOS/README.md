# OpenNOW iOS

Native iPhone/iPad GeForce NOW client with hardware decoding, HDR and 4:4:4 streaming, MetalFX spatial upscaling, controller/touch input, pointer capture, picture in picture and per-game stream profiles. Frame generation is removed.

## Metal rendering

Metal 4 is opt-in through **Settings → Stream → Metal 4 Rendering** or the live stream **Picture** panel. It defaults off, including for existing settings without the new key. When enabled on supported iOS 26+ devices, Metal 4 handles direct HDR rendering, native color conversion, sharpening and MetalFX. Turning it off uses compatible rendering while preserving HDR, color and MetalFX choices. The display layer's residency set is registered with each Metal 4 queue, and frames present directly to its drawables. The block repair was verified on an iPhone in build 149 with HEVC 10-bit 4:4:4 HDR and active MetalFX. See [renderer architecture and validation](METAL4.md).

Build 150 removes the diagnostic presentation-copy experiment, launch overrides, developer HUD and disk/per-frame trace machinery. Normal stream stats and error reporting remain. Existing settings load without the removed developer-HUD key; video and input choices are preserved. Historical experiment notes and pre-cleanup sources are archived locally under `Build/cleanup-before-150`.

## Build on an Apple Silicon Mac

Install full Xcode providing the iOS 27 SDK and its iOS platform. Run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
python3 ios/OpenNOWiOS/BuildScripts/prepare-native-libraries.py
xcodebuild build \
  -project ios/OpenNOWiOS/OpenNOWiOS.xcodeproj \
  -scheme OpenNOWiOS \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -derivedDataPath DerivedData \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

The preparation script downloads the matching static OpenSSL/usrsctp XCFrameworks, verifies the pinned SHA-256, and installs only their framework directories. The native C libraries are unchanged from build 128, so the preparation script reuses that checksum-pinned archive. Generated libraries and build outputs are ignored by Git. WebRTC remains the vendored framework already in the upstream repository. For a source build of the native dependencies, install CMake and run:

```sh
python3 ios/OpenNOWiOS/BuildScripts/build-native-protocol-libs.py --cmake /path/to/cmake
```

The unsigned device app is in `DerivedData/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/OpenNOWiOS.app`. To run directly from Xcode, open `ios/OpenNOWiOS/OpenNOWiOS.xcodeproj` and select your signing team. The native dependency archives contain arm64 device and arm64 simulator slices.

## Native receiver

The native NVST receiver requires an advertised RTSPS endpoint and compatible hardware decoding. HEVC 10-bit 4:4:4 is validated against the actual bitstream and received surface, preserving chroma/depth or reporting an unsupported format. Ordinary WebRTC and compatible rendering remain available on their supported paths.

Native microphone carriage requires a host bundle offering it and the microphone option enabled. Protocol provenance, pinned dependencies and licenses are in [NVST](OpenNOWiOS/NVST/README.md).

## Checks

Run the simulator test scheme `OpenNOWiOS`, plus the GPU validation commands in [METAL4.md](METAL4.md). Simulator and Mac checks cannot establish iPhone/iPad performance. Build 149 verified the visible iPhone block repair; consistent 120 FPS, the separate decoder recovery event and physical iPad behavior remain separate validation targets.

## Controller rumble diagnostics

Build 152 adds a direct output test under Settings → Input → Touch & Controller. Connect the G8+ MFi, check the reported controller name/category and iOS haptics availability, then use Test Controller Rumble. Left/right tests appear only for exposed handle outputs. A successful API call reports acceptance, not proof that the physical motors moved. The pulse lasts 0.4 seconds; Stop Test, leaving the page, backgrounding and connection changes clean up the test engine. No stream or phone vibration fallback is used.

If controller haptics are unavailable, the normal GameController API cannot drive this controller's motors in its current connection/firmware state. If the direct test works but game rumble does not, investigate host haptic events and controller-slot routing next. No unsupported vendor protocol or firmware change is attempted by this branch.
